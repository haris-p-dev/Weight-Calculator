--Weight Calculator
This is a simple Java console application built as a personal exercise to familiarize myself with the language.

--Concept
The program's core functionality is a Weight Converter, inspired by a tutorial (Bro Code) but implemented independently for practice.

--Purpose
The goal of this project was to practice basic Java elements like I/O (Scanner), method declaration, and control flow logic.

A second version with the exact same functionality, but using a completely different implementation logic, is planned for future practice on Regular Expressions.
